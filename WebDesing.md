# Web Design

## Typography

Use between 15px - 25px body font size, also the line-height should by between 1.2 - 1.5; the paragraph should by 78 character long; the title can by really bigger, but if is more bigger use a lighter font weight; use *sans-serif* fonts, you can use *serif* fonts for long text (on the body for example) or simply combine the two.

## Colors

The colors are the essential part of the website, so you need to create a color base palette, for that use color generators, when you have a color palette, use the main color to highlight important stuff, like call to action buttons, important text or links, etc. donâ€™t use black for any reason; learn the psychology of colors.

## Images

When you use a image for background and put some text over, use a dark or any color filter to darken the background and highlight the text; also you can use a transparent color box that wrap the text and highlight that; other solution can by use a blur effect on the image; floor fade are a technique to generate a darken shadow on the Botton of the image (also can by gradient).

## Icons

Use icons for features, steps, links or actions to help and guide the user on the webpage; use icons that are recognizable and understandable next to text; always use the icons to help and support.

## Layout

Put whitespace in your elements like sections, groups, message or any else, but by careful with exaggerate; you need to create a hierarchy on the website and separate the elements that correspond to a section and other; define what do you want to see first the user and then go with the other sections that correspond the flow of the content message.

## UI/UX

The UI is the interface that the user use to manage the website and the UX are the most efficient way to use your website, with not confuse the user and bring the most elegant and efficient manage the website.
